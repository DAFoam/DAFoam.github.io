The DAFoam project began in 2014 in the MDO Lab (headed by Dr. Joaquim Martins) at the University of Michigan. Its initial development was funded by a Ford Motor Company project led by Dr. Kevin Maki and Dr. Joaquim Martins. Dr. Charles (Sandy) Mader created the initial framework for DAFoam. In 2016, Dr. Ping He joined the MDO Lab to further advance the DAFoam development. In 2019, DAFoam was released as open-source software on GitHub. Dr. Ping He joined the Iowa State University in 2020 and continued to lead the DAFoam development. The following is a list of contributors to the DAFoam's source code development (ranked by the number of line changes).

- Ping He and his lab members, Iowa State University (2020 to now) 
- Ping He, University of Michigan (2016 to 2020)
- Charles (Sandy) Mader, University of Michigan (2014 to 2020)
- Bernardo Pacini, University of Michigan (2020 to 2024)
- Omid Bidar, University of Sheffield (2020 to 2024).

In addition to the initial support from the Ford Motor Company, we acknowledge funding support to further develop DAFoam by these research projects.
