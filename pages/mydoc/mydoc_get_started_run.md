The following is an aerodynamic shape optimization case for the NACA0012 airfoil at low speed:

<pre>
Case: Airfoil aerodynamic optimization 
Geometry: NACA0012
Objective function: Drag coefficient (CD)
Lift coefficient (CL): 0.5
Design variables: 20 free-form deformation (FFD) points moving in the y direction, one angle of attack
Constraints: Symmetry, volume, thickness, and lift constraints (total number: 34)
Mach number: 0.02941 (10 m/s)
Reynolds number: 0.6667 million
Mesh cells: ~4,000
Solver: DASimpleFoam
</pre>

To run this case, first download [tutorials](https://github.com/DAFoam/tutorials/archive/main.tar.gz) and untar/extract it. Since we use the pre-compiled DAFoam Docker image, we need to first start the Docker container (a light-weight virtual machine). If you use **Linux**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_linux.html). If you use **MacOS**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_mac.html). If you use **Windows 10**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_windows10.html), If you use **Windows 11**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_windows11.html).

The above command will start a Docker container, mount the **current directory** on your local OS (tutorials-main/NACA0012_Airfoil/incompressible) to the container's **mount** directory, log in to the container's mount directory as dafoamuser, and set the relevant DAFoam environmental variables. You may see something like this on your terminal: `dafoamuser@00fb6ceac4da:~/mount$`. 

**Now you are on the DAFoam Docker container**, run the preProcessing.sh script to generate the mesh:

<pre>
./preProcessing.sh
</pre>

Then, use the following command to run the optimization with 4 CPU cores:

<pre>
mpirun -np 4 python runScript.py 2>&1 | tee logOpt.txt
</pre>

The optimization progress will be printed to the screen and also written to logOpt.txt (we will elaborate on logOpt.txt later on [this page](mydoc_get_started_runscript.html)). This case ran for 18 optimization iterations and took about 15 minutes with an Intel 3.0 GHz CPU.

{% include note.html content="For MacOS and Windows, make sure you open the Docker Desktop app before running Docker commands." %}

{% include note.html content="Treat the Docker container as disposable, i.e., start one container for one optimization run. If the optimization is running and you want to kill it, press `ctr+c` or `ctr+\`. After the optimization is done, type `exit` to exit the Docker container and free up the occupied memory." %}

{% include note.html content="Before re-running a case, run `./Allclean.sh` to clean up the previous optimization results." %}

Check [this page](mydoc_get_started_post_processing.html) for interpreting and post processing the optimization results.
