We are launching a feedback campaign to better understand the experiences of DAFoam users.  

Your input on what works well and what could be improved will directly help us improve the DAFoam ecosystem.  

If you are interested in sharing your thoughts in a 30-minute Zoom meeting, please email me (Ping He, phe@iastate.edu) to arrange a time.  

Your feedback is very important for us, and we greatly appreciate your support in shaping the future of DAFoam.
