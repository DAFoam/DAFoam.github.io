We have released a new DAFoam version v4.0.3. This update fixed bugs and added a few new features such as topology optimization with conjugate heat transfer, unsteady field inversion machine learning with dynamic meshes, and a density-based solver (DAHisaFoam) for high-speed flows. Check [here](https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/releases/tag/v4.0.3) for more details.
