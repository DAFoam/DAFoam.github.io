- Ask questions you’re wondering about.
- Share ideas.
- Engage with other community members.
- Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together.

To get started, post a comment [here](https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/discussions) with an introduction of yourself and tell us about what you do with this community.
