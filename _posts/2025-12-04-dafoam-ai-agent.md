Airfoil and wing aerodynamic design optimizations have never been easier! 

We have recently released a new AI agent that enables conversational analysis, design, and optimization of airfoils and wings. 

The entire design workflow, including geometry generation, meshing, simulations/optimizations, and post-processing, is tightly integrated with an large language model (LLM). 

Users can directly translate the design intent to high-quality design outcomes through natural language inputs. Check out the details from [here](https://dafoam.github.io/ai-agent-overview.html).
